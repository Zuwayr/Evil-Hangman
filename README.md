# Evil-Hangman
Hangman with a twist!

An assignment for CS200 at LUMS
The goal was to make the game unwinnable. This is done by removing all the words from the dictionary containing the character the player enters. 
After five turns, we stop asking user for input and tell them that they have lost the game. 
We print out the first word we have left in the dictionary.
